## About the game
A player is fighting against enemy ships. The player has a modern fighter plane and can shoot with fireballs that can destroy any ship. For each destroyed enemy the player will gain 20 points. The purpose of the game is to take as much points as possible to beat the highscore of other gamers. There are 3 types of enemies:

- Gunships - can shoot with with lasers;
- Carrierships - don't shoot, but can destroy enemy with itself;
- Chaserships - chase a player across the gameboard and destroy the plane.

## Instructions
A player can move the plane with ARROW KEYS and shoot with SPACE bar. The player's plane can explode by enemy's laser or by enemy ship itself. Avoid enemy ships and lasers and destroy them.

### Game Design & Development
- In order to get started with the game, I had to start by going through a tutorial on how to use Phaser [here](http://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game). This alongside the phaser documentation and examples provided the basic knowledge.

#### Assets
- I used assets from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/)

#### Development
- To develop the game I used Phaser Examples, tutorials and relative videos.
